# ST-RoomNet
Official code for ST-RoomNet
The spatial transformer module is based on this repo: https://github.com/dantkz/spatial-transformer-tensorflow
We modified the spatial transformer module to work in Tensorflow2.x and added more features such as nearest neigbour iterpolation in addition to the original bilinear and bicubic interpolations.
